I am glad I did not purchase the one year only MS-365 office.
The one year only MS 365 office may be part of the crowdstrike outage.
Also I don't like software tied to an MS account and the World Wide Web.

I have been using a 10 year old perpertual Office.
I know where things are and I don't have to relearn office every
couple of years.

I still use win 10. I like shelf win 11 until I satisfied it is stable.

I also have been able to avoid microsoft account linked to my beast
system.

My beast computer has hot swappable drives so I don't
even have to open the case to pull out the c drive.

I do like to keep my operating system drive around 256gb.
Cloning 1tc drivecan take a couple of hours?
